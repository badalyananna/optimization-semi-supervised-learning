<h1> This repository contains 4 optimization algorithms: Gradient Descent, Randomized BCGD, Cyclic BCGD and BCGD with Gauss Southwell rule</h1>

common.py contains the functions to calculate the gradient, the objective function and stepsizes

GradientDescent contains the implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm.

RandomBCGD.py contains the implemetation of the Randomized BCGD algorithm.

CyclicBCDG.py contains our implementation of the Cyclic BCGD algorithm.

GaussSouthwellBCDG.py contains our implementation of the Gauss Southwell BCGD algorithm.

config.yml contains the parameters used to run the algorithms in main.ipynb.

main.ipynb shows the results of running the algorithms on randomly generated data points as well as on the real  dataset.
