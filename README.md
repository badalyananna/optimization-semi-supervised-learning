<h1> This repository contains 3 optimization algorithms: Gradient Descent, Randomized Block Coordinate Gradient Descent and Cyclick Block Coordinate Gradient Descent</h1>

common.py contains the functions to calculate the gradient, the objective function, Lipshitz constant and plot the graphs

GradientDescent contains the implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm.

RandomBCGD.py contains the implemetation of the Randomized Block Coordinate Gradient Descent algorithm.

CyclicBCDG.py contains our implementation of the Cyclick Block Coordinate Gradient Descent algorithm.

config.yml contains the parameters used to run the algorithms in main.ipynb.

main.ipynb shows the results of running the algorithms on randomly generated data points as well as on the real world dataset.

<h1> Following steps demonstrate the process to run the code above:</h1>

1. **main.ipynb** is where we are running all the modules of the code
2. Just click run all then see the results
